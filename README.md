# H-Motion
H-Motion â€“ Control Arduino components (such as DC motors) using hand gestures. This project integrates Python and Arduino to detect hand gestures and map them to hardware actions. By leveraging computer vision, users can intuitively interact with motors and similar Arduino-based implementations.
